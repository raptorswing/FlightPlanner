# FlightPlanner
Hierarchical UAV flight planner

This program is an experimental flight planner for simulated unmanned aerial vehicles (i.e. UAVs or "drones").
I wrote it as part of my master's thesis, [Sensor-Driven Hierarchical Path Planning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Using Canonical Tasks and Sensors](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/3798/).

It uses a combination of A*, genetic algorithms, and love to generate a UAV flight path that satisfies constraints and achieves configurable tasks.
